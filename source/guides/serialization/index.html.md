# Serialization

In order to build JSON API documents from your data, you need to define some
*serializable resources*. Serializable resources encapsulate your domain objects
(which can be any kind of objects -- `ActiveRecord`s, POROs, etc.) and present
them in a suitable way for JSON API serialization. They are defined via an
intuitive yet extensive DSL. In other libraries, serializable resources are
usually called "serializers".

Once your serializable resources are defined, you can pass your business objects
to the *renderer*, that will build the appropriate serializable resources, and
render them into a JSON API document.
